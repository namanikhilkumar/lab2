            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The increasing demand for sustainable and maintenance-free energy sources has led to the development of innovative energy harvesting technologies. This study focuses on designing and optimizing a MEMS-based energy harvesting device using piezoelectric materials to convert beta particle energy from a radioactive isotope into electrical energy. By varying the thickness, length, and width of the piezoelectric materials, the study aims to maximize displacement and voltage output. The device features a copper cantilever structure to efficiently capture electrons emitted by a Nickel-63 source.</p>

            <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
            <p>Energy harvesting technologies have gained significant attention over the past two decades as alternatives to conventional power sources for small-sized and low-power electronic devices. The need for periodic recharging or replacement of batteries has been a consistent issue for portable, remote, and implantable devices.</p>
            <h3>Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition and Mechanism:</strong> Piezoelectric energy harvesting converts dynamic mechanical energy into electrical energy using piezoelectric materials. This method focuses on harvesting low-level energy (microwatts to milliwatts) to power low-power electronics.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Piezoelectric transduction is advantageous over thermal and solar harvesting because ambient vibrations are persistent due to operational conditions, making it reliable and useful in embedded systems where thermal and solar energy might be absent.</p>
            <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Common applications include providing energy for low-power electronics such as embedded electronics, implantable biomedical devices, wireless sensor nodes, and portable electronics. These systems offer a permanent, autonomous power source, reducing costs associated with battery replacement and enabling deployment in remote or embedded locations.</p>

        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>

The cantilever's dimensions were optimized to enhance energy conversion efficiency. A copper cantilever, with dimensions 500 µm × 100 µm × 2 µm, was selected to effectively capture electrons from the Nickel-63 source.</p>

        <h2> Addendum</h2>
        <p> In creating an Html document I have chosen a research paper which I have menu scripted during my Bachelors  and the title of the paper and the research is done by me during my bachelors the title of the paper is Shape and Material Optimization of Piezoelectric Transducers for Energy Harvesting.</p>
        <p>
            I have used Sematic Html tags such as <header> for the main title and <nav> navigation tags for navigating the menu which allows the user to jump from one section to other section easily.
        </p>
        <p> 
        Sections of the content is divided using <section> tags so that the document is organized in a neat structured way which would allow users to read it easily
        </p>
        <p>
            <nav> navigation tags are used to navigate easily from one section to other section like from Abstract to Introduction, Problem statement to Objective, which is useful for users to navigate easily.
        </p>
        <p> 
        <p> I have used the paragraph tags for writing the content in paragraph which would be in more structured way 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have presented lot of data using table tag <tr>, for presenting the values of dimensions, voltage developed and piezoelectric materials used in a well organized way so that user can read it easily with out any confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have used article tags for addendum.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I used footer which will display the last modified time date in the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I have used tags like header, navigation, paragraphs, table, article and footer to neatly organize and convert the paper into webpage using Html.
